$ExoNUM.1: PDCP provides services
[ ] for resequencing
[x] for security
[ ] for segmentation/assembly
[ ] for error detection
[x] for header compression
[ ] for error correction
[ ] for resource allocation
[x] to handle problems linked to handovers


$ExoNUM.2: At which level of the radio interface is security handled?
[[(PDCP), RLC, MAC, PHY (Physical layer)]]

$ExoNUM.3: At which level of the radio interface is error detection handled?
[[PDCP, RLC, MAC, (PHY (Physical layer))]]

$ExoNUM.4: At which level of the radio interface is resource allocation handled?
[[PDCP, RLC, (MAC), PHY (Physical layer)]]

$ExoNUM.5: At which level of the radio interface is packet segmentation and assembly handled?
[[PDCP, (RLC), MAC, PHY (Physical layer)]]

$ExoNUM.6: Which level of the radio interface provides services to help transition from one cell to another?
[[(PDCP), RLC, MAC, PHY (Physical layer)]]

$ExoNUM.7: Which layer builds transport blocks?
[[PDCP, RLC, (MAC), PHY (Physical layer)]]


$ExoNUM.8: Which layers have retransmission functions?
[ ] PDCP
[x] RLC
[x] MAC
[ ] PHY
[explanation]
The MAC layer retransmits transport blocks thanks to the HARQ protocol.
The RLC layer in AM mode (Acknowledged Mode) can also retransmit packets.
