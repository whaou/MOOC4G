$ExoNUM.1: A resource element (RE) contains (several answers):
[x] One symbol
[ ] A variable number of symbols (it depends on the chosen modulation)
[ ] One bit
[x] A variable number of bits (it depends on the chosen modulation)

[explanation]
Each RE contains one symbol. The number of bits coded over this symbol depends on the modulation used.
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.2: A Resource Block (RB) typically contains:
[ ] 7 resource elements (RE)
[ ] 12 resource elements (RE)
[x] 84 resource elements (RE)
[ ] A variable number of resource elements (RE)

[explanation]
A resource block is spread in frequency over 12 sub-carriers and lasts 7 symbols (typically).
So, it contains 12x7=84 resource elements.
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.3: When operating on a 20MHz wide channel, how many resource blocks (RB) are available every 0,5ms?
=100

[explanation]
Remember that LTE allows different bandwidths. A number of resource blocks corresponds to each bandwidth. For example:
  - 1,4 MHz bandwidth: 6 resource blocks
  - 5 MHz bandwidth: 25 resource blocks
  - 20 MHz bandwidth: 100 resource blocks
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.4: In LTE, resources are allocated:
( ) every 0,5ms
(x) every 1ms
( ) for a fixed duration upon the connection of a UE
[explanation]
Resources are allocated at each sub-frame, that is to say every millisecond.
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.5: The transmission duration of a transport block is:
( ) Always equal to or less than 0,5ms
(x) Always equal to or less than 1ms
( ) Can be over 1ms if the size of the block is important
[explanation]
Transport blocks are transmitted on a given sub-frame, that is to say in 1ms.
If the amount of data to be transmitted is more important than the capacity of a transport block, data is split over several blocks.

Note: Later, we will see that if an error occurs, the block can be retransmitted. In that case, its complete transmission will last over one millisecond. But each (re)transmission lasts less than 1ms.
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.6: The size of the transport blocks (number of bits per transport block):
[ ] Is fixed
[x] Can vary depending on the modulation used
[x] Can vary depending on the number of available resource blocks
[explanation]
A transport block corresponds to the amount of data we can send from (or to) a given user in one sub-frame (that is to say in 1 ms).
If many resource blocks are available (for example if few users need to transmit at this time), we can form a large transport block.
Also, depending on the MCS (Modulation/coding rate couple), more or less useful information can be transmitted on each resource block.
[explanation]
