$ExoNUM.1: Which of the following suggestions are correct (2 answers expected)?
[x] In a contention protocol, there can be collisions.
[ ] In a contention protocol, there cannot be collisions.
[ ] In a reservation protocol, there can be collisions.
[x] In a reservation protocol, there cannot be collisions.

[explanation]
A collision occurs when several users transmit simultaneously. By definition, this can only happen for contention protocols.
On the other hand, reservation protocols define rules to access the channel to avoid collisions from occurring.
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.2: LTE is mainly:
( ) a contention protocol
( ) a fixed reservation protocol
(x) a dynamic reservation protocol
[explanation]
In LTE, the resource is split in resource blocks (RB) that are dynamically allocated by the eNB so that a single user uses a resource each time.
[explanation]

$ExoNUM.3: The eNB is not allowed to transmit on the random access channel.
(x) True
( ) False
[explanation]
Indeed, the random access channel is defined on the uplink. eNBs are not supposed to use this channel.
[explanation]

$ExoNUM.4: In order to get known by the eNB, a newcomer transmits its TMSI on the random access channel.
( ) True
(x) False
[explanation]
To get known, the new terminal indeed transmits on the random access channel. But this channel does not allow information to be transmitted (except the sequence number used to transmit).

The terminal will communicate its TMSI to the eNB. But later, on the data channel, when the eNB has allocated it a resource for this purpose.
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.5: Let us consider two UEs that are connecting simultaneously. They could use the same RA-RNTI.
(x) True
( ) False
[explanation]
The RA-RNTI is calculated from the sequence number used to transmit on the random access channel. If two terminals use the same sequence and transmit in the same 1-ms sub-frame, they will have an identical RA-RNTI.
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.6: If the access requests of two different terminals collide, the conflict is resolved by the MME.
( ) True
(x) False
[explanation]
No, it is resolved by the base station by resending to the terminal an echo of the connection request.
[explanation]
