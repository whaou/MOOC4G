$ExoNUM.1: Choose the correct suggestions.
[ ] BPSK modulation is more sensitive to perturbations than QPSK
[x] BPSK modulation is less sensitive to perturbations than QPSK
[ ] BPSK modulation provides a higher bandwidth than QPSK
[x] BPSK modulation provides a lower bandwidth than QPSK

[explanation]
BPSK modulation (Binary Phase Shift Keying) is more robust than QPSK (Quaternary Phase Shift Keying).
Indeed, it can code 1 bit/symbol while QPSK codes 2 bits/symbol. The "distance" between the different combinations is greater in BPSK. So it is easier to distinguish them upon reception. So it is less sensitive to perturbations.
On the other hand, the provided bandwidth is two times higher in QPSK since we transmit 2 bits per symbol in QPSK instead of only one in BPSK.

$ExoNUM.2: LTE includes an error correcting system.
(x) True
( ) False

$ExoNUM.3: Choose the number of bits per symbol in BPSK.
(x) 1 bit / symbol
( ) 2 bits / symbol
( ) 3 bits / symbol
( ) 4 bits / symbol
( ) 6 bits / symbol
( ) 8 bits / symbol
[explanation]
The "B" in BPSK stands for "Binary". So there are two possible states (0 or 1). So, only one bit can be coded.
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.4: In LTE, two users can use different modulations.
(x) True
( ) False

[explanation]
One of the strengths of LTE is that modulation can be adapted for each user.
So a same eNB can simultaneously use a fast modulation to communicate with a terminal that is close to it and use a more robust modulation with a UE for which propagation conditions are less favorable.
