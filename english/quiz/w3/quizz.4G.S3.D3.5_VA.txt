In this section, we will assume that the resource is fairly shared between several users. In order to keep calculations simple, we assume there are 3 users. The reasoning we will use can easily be generalized from 3 users to any number of users. 
User 1 is in case 1 (MCS 28). User 2 is in case 2 (MCS 16). And user 3 is in case 3 (MCS 0).

We reason on the average bandwidth perceived by the users. We can assume that they receive a very long file and that they do not notice that the transmission is split in blocks. They cannot at all perceive that there is not necessarily a transmission each ms. 

$ExoNUM10: We assume that the base station transmits in turns to each user. That is to say, it changes for a new recipient at each sub-frame. What is the bandwidth allocated to each?
>>Which bandwidth has user 1? Write the result in Mb/s with +/- 0.1Mb/s<<
= 6.1 +- 0.1

$ExoNUM11: >> Which bandwidth has user 2? Write the result in Mb/s with +/- 0.1Mb/s<<
= 2.6 +- 0.1

$ExoNUM12: >> Which bandwidth has user 3? Write the result in Mb/s with +/- 0.1Mb/s<<
= 0.2 +- 0.1


[explanation]
Now, each user is allocated a transport block every 3 ms instead of every millisecond unlike previously. So we need to divide the results of the previous questions by 3.
[explanation]

$ExoNUM13: >>What is the average bandwidth per user? Write the result in Mb/s with +/- 0.1Mb/s<<
= 2.9 +- 0.2

[explanation]
We average the 3 previous results: 6.1 + 2.6 + 0.2 =~ 2.9 Mb/s.
Note: we add a +/- 0.2Mb/s tolerance for those who have not rounded in the same way.
[explanation]

$ExoNUM14: >>According to you, is this average bandwidth representative of the bandwidth perceived by the users?<<
( ) Yes
(x) No

[explanation]
No, we mainly tend to remember things that do not work, when the bandwidth is slow. So we have to consider the lowest bandwidth provided.
