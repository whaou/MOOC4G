$ExoNUM.6: >>How many resource block pairs are available each ms (You may need to refer to a table given in the course material) ?<<
= 25

[explanation]
The answer is directly given in the table of the second video of the course (see also the course material).
These values are taken from the 3GPP standard (TS 136 104, Table 5.2-1).

$ExoNUM.7: >>What is the maximal bandwidth we can reach in this configuration? Write the result in Mb/s with +/- 0.1Mb/s (use the . to separate decimals from units and do not write any unit of measurement, example: 4.5)<<
=18.336 +- 0.1

[explanation]
In the table of the second video, we can see that the maximum size of a transport block on 25 RB (for MCS 28) is 18336 bits. Since each ms we transmit to the same user, we need to multiply this value by 1000 to get the bandwidth Mb/s, so 18.336 Mbit/s.
