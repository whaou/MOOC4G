$ExoNUM.1: In LTE, the radio resource allocation is handled by:
( ) The core network
(x) eNodeBs
( ) Terminals
( ) jointly by eNodeBs and Terminals
[explanation]
In the LTE architecture, the eUTRAN is supervised by the eNodeBs.
Within a cell, the supervision of radio resource allocation is fully centralized in the eNB.
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.2: Devices that have nothing to transmit use as much resources as the others.
( ) True
(x) False
[explanation]
LTE only allocates resources if there is a proven communication need.
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.3: On the downlink, only the base station transmits.
(x) True
( ) False
[explanation]
Indeed, in the downward direction, all transmissions are done by the eNB.
But you must understand that all available resources must nevertheless be shared between the different terminals because all the UEs can potentially need to receive data.
[explanation]

$ExoNUM.4: The eNB can transmit on the uplink (from the UEs to the eNB).
( ) True
(x) False
[explanation]
The uplink is only used by the UEs to send data to the eNB.
The distribution of these resources is indeed determined by the eNB. But the eNB publishes the allocation table on the downlink.
[explanation]



$ExoNUM.5: The RNTI:
[ ] Is a short address calculated from the IMSI
[ ] Is determined by the UE
[x] Is determined by the eNB
[x] Is a way to uniquely identify a terminal within a cell

[explanation]
The RNTI is allocated by the eNB. So, its uniqueness is only guaranteed within the cell.
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.6: The base station publishes:
[x] The allocation table of the downlink for the current sub-frame
[ ] The allocation table of the downlink 4 sub-frames in advance
[ ] The allocation table of the uplink for the current sub-frame
[X] The allocation table of the uplink 4 sub-frames in advance

[explanation]
At each sub-frame, the eNB publishes on the control channel the allocation table for the downlink and the fourth next sub-frame for the uplink. This gives some time to the terminals to prepare their transport blocks and their transmission.
[explanation]


$ExoNUM.7: If they only have a small amount of data to send, terminals can transmit on the control channel of the uplink.
( ) True
(x) False
[explanation]
Control channels are not meant to transport useful data.
In any case, if a terminal wants to transmit data, it first has to send a resource request. It will then be allocated a resource on the data channel that it can use to send its data.
